## Introduction

**Algotiqa** is a platform specifically designed for algorithmic trading. The idea is to design a platform that helps
algo traders to:

- Write trading systems, using a simple IDE and leveraging a programming language specifically designed for trading
- Run them in a sandbox, taking data from a data provider and executing trades in a broker
- Monitor all activities, alerting traders when new issues arise
- Manage the portfolio, automatically selecting which systems should be activated and which ones should be deactivated

What you won't find here:
- All tools needed for a discretionary trader (like technical analysis, sketching on charts)

Even though the platform is designed to be generic, we will initially focus on **Futures trading**. Demand for other instrument types (*options*, *stocks*, *forex*, *crypto*) will be addressed later, when the platform will be mature and stable enough on Futures.

## Goals

Simply stated, the **Algotiqa** platform will try to address all pain points of current systems. Specifically:

- No need to manually rollover any contract. The platform will automatically roll contracts a few days before expiration
- No need for continuous contracts or custom futures. The platform will automatically build continuous contracts on the fly
- As a consequence of the previous bullet, no need to reload continuous contracts at every rollover
- Money (costs, point value) at broker level. This allows traders to use data from big contracts (like ES, NQ, CL, GC,
  ...) when trading micro instruments (like MES, MNQ, MCL, MGC, ...)
- No need to turn on/off trading systems. This can be done automatically specifying filters
- Robustness: a trading system's position must never go out of sync with the associated position in the broker
- The lack of easy programming languages specifically designed for trading
- Missing of deep monitoring tools and alerting systems
- Missing of a development environment focused at crafting trading systems

## Current status

The platform is under active development and the implemented features can be seen from the screenshots below.

Currently, the platform can be used to:
- Periodically connect to an external trading system to collect metrics
- Analyze the collected metrics
- Monitor the profit and loss of all systems
- Connect to Tradestation™ to retrieve products and their data

What is under development (in this order):
- Portfolio management
- Tiq
- The IDE
- The trading engine
